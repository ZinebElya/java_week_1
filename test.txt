As the sun rose over the horizon, the small town of Millfield slowly awakened from its slumber.
The streets, which had been deserted just a few hours before, were now bustling with activity as the residents went about their daily routines.
The smell of fresh coffee wafted out of the local cafes, while the sound of schoolchildren's laughter filled the air.
It was just another ordinary day in Millfield, but for the people who lived there, it was home, and there was nowhere else they'd rather be.
